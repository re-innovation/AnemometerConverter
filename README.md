# AnemometerConverter
A simple unit to convert an AC anemometer output to a digital pulse train.

## Why is it needed?

## What are the specifications?

1) from a voltage supply of 15 V down to 3.3 V (and it can go even lower);
2) from 200 Hz down to 0.01 Hz (10 mHz) (higher than the highest recording of 125 Hz); and
3) down to 60 mVpp (lower than the required 80 mVpp).

## What equipment is required?

## PCB design
